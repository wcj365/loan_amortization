# Loan Amortization

Formula to calculate monthly loan payments:

$M = P \\dfrac{r (1 + r)^n }{(1 + r)^n - 1}$

- M	= the monthly loan payment (include principal and interest payment)
- P	= the principal loan amount
- r	= the monthly interest rate (annual rate devided by 12)
- n	= number of payments over the loanâ€™s lifetime (years times 12)
