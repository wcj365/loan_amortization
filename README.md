## Formula to calculate monthly loan payments

$M = P \\dfrac{R (1 + R)^N }{(1 + R)^N - 1}$

- M = the monthly loan payment (principal + interest)
- P	= the principal loan amount
- R	= the interest rate (monthly. annual rate devided by 12)
- N	= number of payments over the loanâ€™s lifetime (loan years times 12)

## Formula to calculate interest payment for a given month

$int = olb * R$

- int = interest payment
- olb = outstanding loan balance

Note: Interest payment varies from month to month.
