The monthly mortgage payment formula
Here’s a formula to calculate your monthly payments manually:

$M = $P \\dfrac{r (1 + r)^n }{(1 + r)^n - 1}

Symbol
M	= the total monthly mortgage payment
P	= the principal loan amount
r	= your monthly interest rate

Lenders provide you an annual rate so you’ll need to divide that figure by 12 (the number of months in a year) to get the monthly rate. 
If your interest rate is 5 percent, your monthly rate would be 0.004167 (0.05/12=0.004167).
n	= number of payments over the loan’s lifetime
Multiply the number of years in your loan term by 12 (the number of months in a year) to get the number of payments for your loan. For example, a 30-year fixed mortgage would have 360 payments (30x12=360).
